# Classifying Emails as Spam or Not Spam Using Naive Bayes

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam. The dataset used contains 5,572 emails, 3,281 of which are spam and 2,291 of which are not spam. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with 3,000 emails in the training set and 2,572 emails in the test set. The training set is used to train the classifier, and the test set is used to evaluate the classifier.
